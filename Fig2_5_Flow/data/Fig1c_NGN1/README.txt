Date of Flow Cytometry Experiments: December 11th, 13th, and 17th 2019
FlowJo File: NGN1_Final.fcs
Processed Excel Spreadsheet: NGN1_Statistics.csv

Quadrants were generated by WT_Control distribution. 
WT_Control was not used to generate any other statistics.

Experiment: 
3 Biological Replicates (Repl1, Repl2, Repl3) 
2 Technical Replicates (ex: Repl1_01, Repl1_02)
NoDox (ex: Repl1_nodox_01.fcs) vs Dox (Repl1_dox_01.fcs) 

Unstained Control example: Repl1_Unstained.fcs
WT Size Control example: Repl1_WT.fcs
	- Not Repl3_WT control file was corrupted, used Repl2_WT.fcs in analysis
